=> commands that take long can not reply
=> I could edit the response later. `interaction.editReply('asdasdasd')`
   prolongs the lifespan of the bot's replyability by 15 minutes.
=> there is also a `interaction.deferReply('asdadasd')`. When called the
   bot will show `thinking...` while working. This also allows for 15
   minutes of taks completion time.
   => await interaction.deferReply() // One can also pass { ephemeral: true }.
      await wait(4000) // Do some calculations or something idk.
      await interaction.editReply('Real Content')
=> interaction.followUp('asdasdasd') allows sending a second message after
   the first one. It will also be a direct reply to the first message by the bot.
